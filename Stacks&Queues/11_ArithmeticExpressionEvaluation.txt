Most frequently used expressions are written in infix notation i.e operator lies between the two operand.
For eg : (A + B) * C is an infix expression.
We need to put parenthesis in the order in which we want to perform the operations and also make use of
operator precedence rule.
Though infix expressions gives readability to humans but for the machines it adds extra burden of handling
the parenthesis and operator precedence rules.

Postfix expressions are usually used by our machinese. In this, operator comes after the operands.
For eg : AB+C* .There is no need of maitaining parenthesis or remembering the operator precedence.

Prefix expressions as the name suggests are expressions in which operators occur before the operand.
For eg : *+ABC

NOTE : One main thing to note is that while converting from infix to postfix or from any conversion
       to other conversion the order of operands in the final expression is always the same.
